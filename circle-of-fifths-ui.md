🧠 Next Steps

Refine macOS-style UI shell for the interface

Experiment with smooth transitions and ambient backgrounds

Consider exporting as a self-contained CircleOfFifths.svelte component

Consider making the keys more responsive to touch--it responds more to the cursor dragging over them rather than my finger...
